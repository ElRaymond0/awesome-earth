Cars and trucks account for [nearly one-fifth of all US emissions](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/car-emissions-and-global-warming). Despite the UK having [more electric charging points than petrol stations](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/now-more-electric-vehicle-charging-18934596.amp?__twitter_impression=true), roughly half of drivers [say they need more charging points](https://www.statista.com/chart/17933/what-is-stopping-uk-drivers-from-buying-an-electric-car/), meaning only [6% of new cars being electric](https://www.statista.com/topics/2298/the-uk-electric-vehicle-industry/). Hoping that everyone will maybe someday switch to electric cars is not any sort of solution for the worlds problems, but lowering or [removing our reliance on personal cars](https://www.wired.com/story/germany-proves-cars-must-die/) can make a big difference.
